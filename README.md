## üí¨ How the Chatbot Works

The Kiboko chatbot currently operates using a predefined set of local responses to ensure speed and reliability. The logic in `src/app/actions.ts` matches keywords in user input (including common misspellings) to provide helpful, instant answers to frequently asked questions.
